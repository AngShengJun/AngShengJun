### End-to-end Data Science Projects
### OCBC HACK-it
Submission for OCBC Hackathon project. Utilizing the US 2015 traffic dataset hosted on Kaggle, derived five insights from visualizations and modelling.
Insights on traffic trends were derived from visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, folium and K-Means clustering
from various angles such as trends by state level, time series, and geo coordinates.
Based on the derived insights, several models were trained and evaluated. The top performing model is further
tuned to explore potential for further model improvement.

### Terror activity classifier
Classification of terror activity from text-based intelligence. Conducted visualization of global terror incidents for trend analysis. End-to-end ML with deployment to Heroku. Explored Topic Modeling and Linear Discriminant Analysis for model improvements.
